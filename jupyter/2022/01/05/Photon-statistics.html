<p>Because of the inherent probability quantum mechanics entails, photons arriving at some detector follow statistical properties. In this chapter I will discuss these <em>Photon Statistics</em> and the unintuitive way photons behave when they arrive sparsely.</p>

</h2>
<p>When looking at an astronomical object far away, the detector is measuring photons that this galaxy randomly emits. This means that in the context of radio astronomy our signal is noise<a class="citation" href="#perley_2008">[1]</a>! When I talk about noise, I therefore don't mean the 'traditional' understanding of noise as static drowning out the song on the radio, but rather photon noise: our signal.</p>
<p>This noise can be split up into two categories: thermal noise and shot noise. In this section I will take a look at both</p>
<h3 id="Thermal-Noise">
<a class="anchor" href="#Thermal-Noise" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thermal Noise<a class="anchor-link" href="#Thermal-Noise"> </a>
</h3>
<p>In radio receivers, a big part of the noise is generated by thermal agitation of electrons. In most uses this can be classified as white noise: the power is constant across its frequency spectrum <a class="citation" href="#turner_2007">[2]</a>, but in extremely high frequencies or low temperatures this approximation doesn't hold. The power $P$ transmitted by the noise is given as Johnson-Nyquist Noise and is approximated for small bandwidths $\Delta\nu$ as<a class="citation" href="#endo_session_4">[3]</a>:</p>
$$
P_\nu=\int_{\nu_0}^{\nu_1}\frac{h\nu}{e^{h\nu/k_BT}-1}d\nu \approx \frac{h\nu}{e^{h\nu/k_BT}-1}\Delta\nu
$$<p>Plotting this normalized ($P_\nu/k_BT$) power spectrum supports my earlier statements that, in  most cases, thermal noise can be approximated as white</p>

<p>From Poisson statistics we know that the uncertainty $\sigma_N$ over a number of measurements is equal to the square root of these measurements, since it's an uncorrelated process (missing reference)<a class="citation" href="#perley_2008">[1]</a>. Since our power arrives with single photons hitting the detector, the power follows the same uncertainty</p>

<p>The seemingly paradoxical nature of this uncertainty can be explained as a caveat of the particle-wave duality. In the wave domain the Johnson-Nyquist noise dominates, whereas in the particle domain we get mainly Poisson noise. The general case of the uncertainty in the number of photons arriving in a detection time of $\tau$ is(missing reference)<a class="citation" href="#paul_2004">[4]</a>:</p>
$$
\sigma_\mathrm{ph}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau}}\sqrt{n^2+n}
$$<p>with $n$, the photon number, being the number of photons per time per bandwidth. Here both extremes are more obvious: for $n\gg 1$ we get the thermal noise from the wave domain and for $n \ll 1$ the Poisson uncertainty falls out.</p>

<p>Quantum Electrodynamics has taught us that photons behave stochastically, so it is reasonable to assume that photon detection also occurs randomly. While this is (obviously) true to some degree, in the previous section I stated photons can arrive 'clumped' together at the detector in a phenomenon known as photon bunching. This means that detecting one photon will result in a higher chance of another photon being detected within a specified time, called the coherence time $t_{\mathrm{coh}}$ (missing reference). In this chapter I will first present an intuitive, <em>qualitative</em> explanation as to why photon bunching occurs. Then I will go deeper into the mathematics and quantum mechanics of photon bunching and the specific case of the DESHIMA system.</p>

</h3>
<p>To understand photon bunching, first think of photons arriving at the detector like raindrops falling on a piece of paper. While it's raining with constant intensity, the chance of a raindrop falling on a specific area within, say, the next second (expressed by $P(\mathrm{drop})$) is constant. In the figure below I have set $P(\mathrm{drop}) = 0.3$:</p>

<p>The raindrops fall uncorrelated: every second a new chance of $P(\mathrm{drop})$ means a raindrop falling from the sky might land in our defined area. This is how unbunched, or random, photons behave.</p>
<p>Now let's assume the chance of a raindrop occurring is not constant over time, but rather varies relatively slowly over time. This could be because of varying wind speeds or varying intensity in the rain, but whatever the case the rain drops are no longer uncorrelated. There are moments of high intensity, where the chance of a raindrop is high and similarly there are moments of low intensity. I have simulated this using open simplex noise <a class="citation" href="#opensimplex">[6]</a> in the following graph.</p>

<p>As is clear from the graph, the raindrops are clumped together. This is the same underlying principle as photon bunching in photons from astronomical sources. The random motion of the exciting atoms, for example Brownian motion, means that the intensity also fluctuates over time<a class="citation" href="#paul_2004">[4]</a>. It is therefore not the act of detecting a photon that increases the chance of another detection, but rather an underlying change in probability of detecting, easily explained by probabilistics.</p>
<p>This means that at the point where a raindrop falls or a photon gets emitted, it is still a simple stochastic process. Should our sampling interval be much smaller than the time over which the rain varies, we'd still see 'stochastic regions', where the probability function stays roughly constant, like in the first example. This is illustrated in the graph below with stretched noise:</p>

<p>The droplets appear less bunched, because the time scale in which the measurements take place is much smaller than the time scale in which the intensity changes. The very first example I spoke about, of raindrops falling at a constant intensity, is a situation in which this discrepancy occurs. Of course it won't rain forever and when the rain dies down the chance of a raindrop falling is <em>much</em> lower than while it's still raining. So while the droplets look purely random when it rains, they aren't over the course of the entire day. I will call this behavior <em>bunched (slow timescale)</em>, because the sampling time is much faster than the coherence time, which I shall later elaborate on further.</p>

<p>While this report focuses on photon bunching, the opposite also occurs in, for example, single photon sources <a class="citation" href="#Krottenm%C3%BCller_2013">[7]</a>. Now that I have discussed a framework with which to explain photon bunching, I thought it would be remiss to leave out an explanation for antibunching.</p>
<p>As one would expect, in antibunching the opposite of bunching happens: detecting a raindrop would mean that, at least for the next <em>period</em> of time, the chance of a raindrop becomes smaller. A good allegory for this is a dripping faucet. A small flow of water exits the faucet and, due to surface tension, pools up in a small droplet at the end. As the droplet gets bigger, the chance of it falling increases, but once it drips down it takes all water with it and the process starts anew.</p>

<p>If the underlying probability function is unknown (and quantum mechanically it is), how would we be able to quantify whether our detections are bunched. A possible heuristic we can use comes from signal processing. We could take the autocorrelation of the signals and compare them. Since the autocorrelation is the cross-correlation between the signal and a time-shifted copy, we'd likely see the bunched signal display some sort of correlation for a delay that is around the timescale of the oscillations in the probability function. In the figure below I have correlated the detections described above with $t\in[0,1000]$ and plotted these values for different time delays $h$</p>

<p>As is clear from the graph, the bunched photons show some autocorrelation, with the longer timescale showing longer (bigger time shifts) autocorrelation. This can be explained further by signal analysis. We are working in the discrete domain and smaller sampling steps relative to the variation in the underlying probability will mean more correlation.</p>
<p>What this shows is temporal coherence, a property of light that describes the predictability over a timescale<a class="citation" href="#perley_2008">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Up until now we have only looked at raindrops and other analogous detections, but when talking about photons we need to take frequency into account. Photons obey the Heisenberg uncertainty relation where the uncertainty in position $\Delta x$ and momentum $\Delta p_x$ must obey <a class="citation" href="#perley_2008">[1]</a>:</p>
$$
\Delta x\Delta p_x = \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$<p>Our photons are flying at the detector, so it's uncertainty in longitudinal ($z$, towards the detector) position can be equated as it's uncertainty in detection time and it's momentum can be expressed as $h/\lambda$:</p>
$$
\Delta z \Delta p_z= \frac{\Delta t}{c} \frac{h}{\Delta\lambda} = \frac{\Delta t}{c} \frac{hc}{\Delta\nu} = \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$<p>and finally we arrive at</p>
$$
\Delta\nu \propto \frac{1}{\Delta t}
$$<p>In other words: a shorter coherence time means more accurate knowledge on where the photons are, meaning their uncertainty in momentum and therefore bandwidth is bigger.</p>
<p>The reverse can also be seen experimentally. In Morgan and Mandel's 1966 paper<a class="citation" href="#morgan_1966">[8]</a>, the authors explore the autocorrelation between two different light sources: a Hg<sup>198</sup> source with a very narrow bandwidth (a) and a tungsten light bulb with a broad spectrum thermal source (b).</p>

<p>Because the tungsten light has a high bandwidth, it has a short coherence time and the reverse is true for the Hg<sup>198</sup> light. Therefore, if we take the short timescale bunched photons as an analogy for the tungsten light and the longer timescale bunched lights as analogous for the mercury light, we get something that looks very similar.</p>

<p>The noise equivalent power ($\mathrm{NEP}$) is a way to express the sensitivity of a photon detectors. It is defined as <em>the input signal power that results in a signal-to-noise-ratio of 1 in a 1 Hz output bandwidth</em>. <a class="citation" href="#richards_1994">[9]</a>. For our purposes this means multiplying the photon noise with the photon energy(missing reference). From <a class="citation" href="#zmuidzinas_2003">[5]</a> we have an equation for the electrical (detected) photon noise</p>
$$
\sigma_\mathrm{ph}^2=\frac{1}{\tau}\int_0^\infty\eta(\nu)n(\nu)\left[1+\eta(\nu)n(\nu)\right]d\nu
$$<p>multiplying this integral with the photon energy, we get the electrical Noise Equivalent Power added by photon noise for a specified integration time</p>
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau,\mathrm{ph}}^2=\frac{1}{\tau}\int_0^\infty\left(h\nu\right)^2\eta(\nu)n(\nu)\left[1+\eta(\nu)n(\nu)\right]d\nu
$$<p>But unfortunately this integral is not easily solvable. As we've seen in the previous section, the coherence time is inversely proportional to the bandwidth and by taking an integral we effectively have an infinitesimal bandwidth and therefore an infinite coherence time.</p>
<p>If we were to create a perfect box filter, and approximate the photon number as constant over this filter we can get around this. Let's first define this box function</p>
$$ \Pi^{\Delta\nu}_{\nu_0}(\nu)=   \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      1 &amp; |\nu-\nu_0|\le\frac{\Delta\nu}{2} \\
      0 &amp; \mathrm{elsewhere} \\
\end{array} 
\right.
$$<p>And then set $\eta(\nu)=\eta_0\Pi^{\Delta\nu}_{\nu_0}(\nu)$. When we assume we have a constant photon occupation number over this range, the equation simplifies to:</p>
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau,\mathrm{ph}}^2=\frac{1}{\tau}\int_0^\infty\left(h\nu\right)^2\eta_0\Pi^{\Delta\nu}_{\nu_0}(\nu)n(\nu)\left[1+\eta_0\Pi^{\Delta\nu}_{\nu_0}(\nu)n(\nu)\right]d\nu = \frac{1}{\tau}\int_{\nu_0-\frac{\Delta\nu}{2}}^{\nu_0+\frac{\Delta\nu}{2}}\left(h\nu\right)^2\eta_0n\left[1+\eta_0n\right]d\nu
$$<p>Which, for $\Delta\nu\ll\nu$ approximates as:
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau,\mathrm{ph}}^2=\frac{1}{\tau}\left(h\nu_0\right)^2\eta_0n\left[1+\eta_0n\right]\Delta\nu
$$</p>
<p>In astrophysics it is convention to take an integration time of $\tau=0.5\:\mathrm{[s]}$ which results in a Noise Equivalent Power of:</p>
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau=0.5\mathrm{s},\mathrm{ph}}=h\nu_0\sqrt{2\eta_0n\left(1+\eta_0n\right)\Delta\nu}
$$

</h3>
<p>In actual measurements the photon occupation number isn't known, but we are able to deduce it from the power impinged on the detector. If we once again place a box filter in front of the detector, the photon number is of course equal to the total number of detected photons multiplied by the efficiency of the filter:</p>
$$
P_\mathrm{KID}=\eta_0\sum_ih\nu_i
$$<p>Which, by virtue of our earlier assumptions is equal to
$$
P_\mathrm{KID}=\eta_0h\nu_0n\Delta\nu
$$
rearranging we get:
$$
n = \frac{P_\mathrm{KID}}{\eta_0h\nu_0\Delta\nu}
$$</p>
<p>Inserting this in the equation for $\mathrm{NEP}$ we get:</p>
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau=0.5\mathrm{s},\mathrm{ph}}=\sqrt{2P_\mathrm{KID}h\nu_0 + 2\frac{P_\mathrm{KID}^2}{\Delta\nu}}
$$<p>Which is in agreement with <a class="citation" href="#endo_2019">[10]</a></p>

<p>1 filter channel is thus approximated as a box integral, this isn't physically possible and therefore inaccurate. To improve on this we can choose to subdivide one (Gaussian profile) filter into a sum of multiple box filters, like a Riemann sum of the integral. This would result in a better approximation of the filter profile</p>

<p>Besides photon noise (both Poisson and bunching), another type of noise adds to our $NEP$: generation-recombination noise. This is a type of noise that occurs in superconductor-based pair-breaking photon detectors, as quasiparticles generate and recombine in a cooper pair (missing reference). For our purposes we will take the noise equivalent power of recombination noise $\mathrm{NEP}&lt;/em&gt;\mathrm{GR}$ as given by <a class="citation" href="#endo_2019">[10]</a>:</p>
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_\mathrm{GR}=\sqrt{4\Delta_\mathrm{Al}\frac{P_\mathrm{KID}}{\eta_\mathrm{pb}}}
$$<p>Since the photon noise $\mathrm{NEP}_\mathrm{ph}$ and the recombination noise $\mathrm{NEP}_\mathrm{GR}$ are uncorrelated, we add them together by quadrature addition, the total noise equivalent power is thus given by:</p>
$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau=0.5\mathrm{s}} = \sqrt{\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau=0.5\mathrm{s},\mathrm{ph}}^2 + \mathrm{NEP}_\mathrm{GR}^2}
$$$$
\mathrm{NEP}_{\tau=0.5\mathrm{s}}=\sqrt{2P_\mathrm{KID}h\nu_0 + 2\frac{P_\mathrm{KID}^2}{\Delta\nu}+4\Delta_\mathrm{Al}\frac{P_\mathrm{KID}}{\eta_\mathrm{pb}}}
